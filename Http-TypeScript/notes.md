# Why Http - point
1. When two computers communicate with each other, they need to use the same rules / language. This "language" that computers use is called a protocol (Http). 

2. requests & response

4. HTTP URLs
A URL, or `Uniform Resource Locator`, is the address of another computer, or "server" on the internet. Part of the URL specifies where to reach the server, and part of it tells the server what information we want.

5. HTTP is the only protocol that uses URLs - false
```
For example, you might have seen other prefixes in URLs like:

ftp:// for File Transfer Protocol
mailto: for email addresses
file:// for local files on your computer

Each of these uses the URL format to point to a specific resource, but they use different underlying protocols for the communication. So, while HTTP is very common, it's certainly not the only protocol that uses URLs!
